####Welcome to my first run at batch scripting
I apologize for the roughness, as this is my first set of .bat files, there has been a lot
of learning and a lot of playing around. The programming at times is not even close to best practices
i.e. hardcoding certain variables, lacking modularity... I chose to do this to simplify in the name of
reducing random errors due to my ignorance when it comes to correct syntax and language understanding.

Part of the reason for this project is to help others learn by example. So, I am half tempted to leave in certain simplicities and bad coding, as it shows the evolution and progress in understanding batch scripting.

These serve as my playground. The sandbox is big enough for all, just be careful in the deepend. 
So, feel free to make comments, suggestions, recomendations, contributions, etc. as I'm always eager to 
see what others do.
