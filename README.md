####Welcome to my first run at batch scripting
I apologize for the roughness, as this is my first set of .bat files, there has been a lot
of learning and a lot of playing around. 

These serve as my playground. The sandbox is big enough for all, just be careful in the deepend. 
So, feel free to make comments, suggestions, recomendations, contributions, etc. as I'm always eager to 
see what others do.
