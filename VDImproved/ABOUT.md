#####Why?

In school, UTSA, certain classes require we use the VDI (virtual desktop infastructure) 
which was implemented in the new CS building. 

While there are many, many benefits of a setup such as this, there can be drawbacks. 
The VDI is implememted in such a way that upon every logon from the user the VM treats 
this as the first time that user has logged in. 

Every time, certain programs run, they go through a first run. The specifics differ from program to program
and from no user impact to a decent cumulative waste of time and the annoyance of doing something repetitively.
As with most other programmers, I abhor this and attemp to automate or bypass all together.
