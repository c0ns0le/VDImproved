ahk will not install on VDI

Download the stand alone 32bit zip, not the installer. 
The default behaviour will execute  AutoHotKey.ahk from the Documents 
folder in the Library, based on each user.

Name or rename the ahk script you want run to AutoHotKey.ahk, now the exe will run this script.
