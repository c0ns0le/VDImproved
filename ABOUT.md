<div id='why'/>
#####Why?

In school, UTSA, certain classes require we use VDI (virtual desktop infastructure) 
which was implemented in the new CS building. 

The VDI is implememted to load the same original image, regardless. ANY changes made, documents saved, etc are lost.
There is a share drive which does get mounted, typcially to v: that is only wiped clean at the end of a semester. 

Working with git and github, especially via CLI has made regular updates problematic. Only due to my lack of understanding git and the git installations on the VDI's. Now it's just a matter of creating a new habit, wish my luck!

Every time, certain programs run, they go through a first run. The specifics differ from program to program
and from no user impact to a decent cumulative waste of time and the annoyance of doing something repetitively.
As with most other programmers, I abhor this and attemp to automate or bypass all together.

#####Instructions

It is important to retain the directory structure for file dependancies.
UTSA will only keep changes made to a network drive with a 3 letter 3 number ID, mounted as the V drive. 

-Extract all files to  V:\
-Execute the V:\VDImproved/startup.bat or restart and the automation will now run at startup

Chrome
-After a while the backup will begin to take a while to restore. Clean out caches before you logout for a fix.

#####TODO's

######General
- Change all fail labels, maybe not all? These code blocks started as pure error logging. They turned into event logging and now the name is no longer correct. Their functioning now requires more dynamic programming, and better, programming.

####### File Specific

I am trying out a script to automate this by searching all project files, limiting by modified after first use, and just copying each instance here.
